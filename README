LuaTeXtra is a collection of three coherent packages:

luatextra provides low-level functions for LuaTeX use with LaTeX and Plain, for
instance the macro \newluaattribute. It also provides a way to use and register
new lua modules, inspired by the LaTeX packages system.

luamcallback provides a way to register several functions in a LuaTeX callback.

luaextra provides extra lua functions useful for package development.

These packages are really necessary if you want to take advantage of the new
LuaTeX functions in a safe way.

Note that this package automatically loads luaotfload.

Please see the luatextra-reference.pdf documentation for more details.

This package is developped on http://github.com/eroux/lualatex/tree/master .
