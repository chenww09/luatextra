                          The luatextra generic bundle


LuaTeXtra is a collection of two coherent packages:

1. luatextra provides low-level functions for LuaTeX use with LaTeX and Plain, for
instance the macro \newluaattribute. It also provides a way to use and register
new lua modules, inspired by the LaTeX packages system.

2. luaextra provides extra lua functions useful for package development.

Note that this package automatically loads luaotfload.

Please see the luatextra-reference.pdf documentation for more details.

This package is developed on <http://github.com/mpg/luatextra/>, see the 'News'
file for version history.
